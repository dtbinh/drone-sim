# Simulating Drone Delivery Networks using SpatialOS

Here's the repository containing all the work I did for my Masters project at Imperial. I used the SpatialOS *SDK* for Unity, but since then the [SpatialOS *GDK* for Unity has launched into Alpha](https://improbable.io/games/blog/spatialos-gdk-for-unity-launch).
