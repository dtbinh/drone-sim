This paper provides a distributed merging and spacing algorithm that maximizes the throughput at the terminal phase of flight using the information provided through the ADS-B framework. Using dual decomposition, aircraft negotiate with each other and reach an agreement on optimal merging times, with respect to an associated cost, that ensures proper inter-aircraft spacing. We provide a feasibility analysis that gives sufficient conditions to guarantee that proper spacing is achievable and derive maximum throughput controllers based on the air traffic characteristics of the merging flight paths.},

@article{Dorling2017,
abstract = {—Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, have the poten-tial to significantly reduce the cost and time of making last-mile deliveries and responding to emergencies. Despite this potential, little work has gone into developing vehicle routing problems (VRPs) specifically for drone delivery scenarios. Existing VRPs are insufficient for planning drone deliveries: either multiple trips to the depot are not permitted, leading to solutions with excess drones, or the effect of battery and payload weight on energy consumption is not considered, leading to costly or infeasible routes. We propose two multi-trip VRPs for drone delivery that address both issues. One minimizes costs subject to a delivery time limit, while the other minimizes the overall delivery time subject to a budget constraint. We mathematically derive and experimentally validate an energy consumption model for multirotor drones, demonstrating that energy consumption varies approximately linearly with payload and battery weight. We use this approximation to derive mixed integer linear programs for our VRPs. We propose a cost function that considers our energy consumption model and drone reuse, and apply it in a simulated annealing (SA) heuristic for finding sub-optimal solutions to practical scenarios. To assist drone delivery practitioners with balancing cost and delivery time, the SA heuristic is used to show that the minimum cost has an inverse exponential relationship with the delivery time limit, and the minimum overall delivery time has an inverse exponential relationship with the budget. Numerical results confirm the importance of reusing drones and optimizing battery size in drone delivery VRPs. Index Terms—Vehicle routing problem (VRP), drone, delivery, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), traveling salesman problem (TSP), simulated annealing (SA), heuristic, mixed integer pro-gram (MIP).},

abstract = {With this growth comes great opportunity for expansion in the market for product delivery. Recent technological innovations, new delivery firms, and new business models have unleashed major disruptions in how products are delivered to customers at the last mile. Whereas in the past customers ordering a product online could expect delivery by traditional players such as UPS, FedEx, or the U.S. Postal Service, today there are myriad options for who arranges for a product delivery and how it arrives in a customer's hands. Both traditional players and new entrants have opportunities to compete in this growing market. Given customers' complex expectations for flexible, fast, and cheap or free delivery, intense market competition, and the variable profitability of last-mile delivery, it is unclear which technologies, firms, and business models will ultimately gain a successful foothold. This paper examines four innovations expected to influence last-mile delivery in the next five to seven years: advanced algorithms and analytics, drones, robots, and driverless vehicles. We also examine key market entrants leveraging these technologies and their emerging business models. Last-mile delivery is generally arranged by one of three parties: a seller, an intermediary, or a buyer. Today, these parties can use traditional means of delivery or new algorithm-and analytics-driven applications (i.e., apps). Tomorrow, drones, robots, and driverless cars may become formidable new choices in various geographic settings and markets. New advanced algorithm-and analytics-based services catering to various customer needs will likely continue to emerge given low barriers to entry. Since the profitability of some of these models may be questionable, innovative firms that can reduce the cost structure through novel models may gain the ultimate advantage. Given that delivery services based on drones or driverless vehicles require heavy up-front investment, it is likely that large sellers or delivery providers will emerge as first movers in this space. In the near term, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has an opportunity to leverage advanced algorithms such as dynamic routing to improve the efficiency of existing business models and develop new models. USPS may also consider drones for select purposes in the future, such as delivery to traditionally high-cost remote locations. Given that robots are likely to have niche applications in smaller communities in the early stages of deployment, they may not present a large opportunity for the U.S. Postal Service in the near term. As the cost of driverless vehicles becomes more competitive with traditional vehicles over time, the USPS may have an opportunity to consider incorporating driverless vehicles within its fleet, with the potential of saving labor and other costs. In the longer term, there is potential for new technologies to improve the vast underutilization of private transport, which may lead to an entirely new transportation infrastructure and new commercial delivery models. For example, as driverless vehicles gain scale, one could envision more shared and/or public transportation. Crowdsourcing delivery companies could leverage private driverless vehicles or companies could deploy their own optimized driverless fleets for delivery. There may eventually come a time when drones, robots, driverless vehicles, and other technologies make it such that humans no longer conduct product delivery. In this scenario, delivery providers would need to rethink their business models and shift to offering services such as delivery orchestration and more. In the distant future, automated systems such as the Physical Internet, envisioned by a coalition of researchers, may develop that would deploy an open global logistics system and would continuously route and monitor products, leveraging the Internet of Things. While it is unclear who the winners and losers will be in future last-mile delivery, it is evident that many opportunities exist for firms to leverage new technologies in order to meet customers' fast-evolving needs.},

@article{Nash2010,
abstract = {Grids with blocked and unblocked cells are often used to represent continuous 2D and 3D environments in robotics and video games. The shortest paths formed by the edges of 8-neighbor 2D grids can be up to ≈ 8{\%} longer than the shortest paths in the continuous environment. Theta* typically finds much shorter paths than that by propagating information along graph edges (to achieve short runtimes) without constraining paths to be formed by graph edges (to find short “any-angle” paths). We show in this paper that the shortest paths formed by the edges of 26-neighbor 3D grids can be ≈ 13{\%} longer than the shortest paths in the continuous environment, which highlights the need for smart path planning algorithms in 3D. Theta* can be applied to 3D grids in a straight-forward manner, but it performs a line-of-sight check for each unexpanded visible neighbor of each expanded vertex and thus it performs many more line-of-sight checks per expanded vertex on a 26-neighbor 3D grid than on an 8-neighbor 2D grid. We therefore introduce Lazy Theta*, a variant of Theta* which uses lazy evaluation to perform only one line-of-sight check per expanded vertex (but with slightly more expanded vertices). We show experimentally that Lazy Theta* finds paths faster than Theta* on 26-neighbor 3D grids, with one order of magnitude fewer line-of-sight checks and without an increase in path length.},

abstract = {The main goal of this research effort is to find a flyable collision-free path for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a dynamic environment. Given that the UAV path planning needs to adapt in near real-time to the dynamic nature of the operational scenario, and to react rapidly to updates in the situational awareness, a modified artificial potential field (MAPF) approach is utilized to provide collision avoidance in view of pop-up threats and a random set of moving obstacles. To ensure a practically reachable trajectory, this paper proposes a constraint reference frame to develop MAPF so that the decomposed forces from MAPF can be matched with the physical constraints of the UAV for online adjustment. Simulations and experimental results provide promising validation in terms of the efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.},

The method is based on the cooperative problem solving with multiple agents. In the truck delivery scheduling method, the covered region is partitioned into multiple sub-regions and each sub-region is assigned a sub-problem solving agent. For integrating those sub-problem solving agents, an integration-and-evaluation agent solves the total problem. We also discuss the functions for building cooperative decision support system in a mobile environment in delivery scheduling domain. We consider a delivery center with function, i.e., generating and integrating delivery schedule, acquiring and managing the information shared commonly by all delivery persons, and dispatching the selected information to delivery persons, and the mobile terminal that a delivery person uses for exchanging information with the center. By employing the multi-agent problem solving framework for the delivery scheduling problem, we achieved an easy incorporation of various evaluation parameters in the process of scheduling, efficient use and management of scheduling knowledge of various levels.},
